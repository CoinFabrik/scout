# Lazy storage on delegate

### What it does

Checks for non-lazy storage when using delegate calls.

### Why is this bad?

`ink!` has a bug that prevents delegate calls from modifying the storage of the caller.

### Example

```rust
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Contract {
       admin: AccountId,
    }
```

Use instead:

```rust
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Contract {
        admin: Lazy<AccountId, ManualKey<12345>>,
    }
```
