# Scout

We are building an extensible open-source tool (or set of tools) to assist ink! smart contract developers detect common security issues and deviations from best practices. To improve coverage and precision, we will persist in research efforts on static and dynamic analysis techniques.

This tool will help developers write secure and more robust smart contracts.

Our interest in this project comes from our experience in manual auditing and our usage of comparable tools in other blockchains.
