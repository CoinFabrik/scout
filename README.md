Scout is an extensible open-source tool intended to assist ink! smart contract developers and auditors detect common security issues and deviations from best practices.

This tool will help developers write secure and more robust smart contracts.

Our interest in this project comes from our experience in manual auditing and our usage of comparable tools in other blockchains.
To improve coverage and precision, weÂ´ll persist in research efforts on static and dynamic analysis techniques. Find more about our ongoing research at our associated repository.

## Quick Start

For a quick start, make sure that [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) is installed on your computer. Then, install Scout dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link
```

Afterwards, install Scout with the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-scout-audit
```

To run Scout on your project, navigate to its root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cargo scout-audit
```

For more information on installation and usage, please refer to the [Getting Started](https://coinfabrik.github.io/scout/docs/intro) section in our documentation below.

## Tests

To validate our tool, we provide a set of code examples located in the [test-cases](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/main/test-cases) folder.

In order to run the integration tests, navigate to `apps/cargo-scout-audit` and run:

```console
cargo test --all --all-features
```

In order to run the tests for a particular test-case, run the same command on that particular test-case folder (e.g: `test-cases/delegate-call/delegate-call-1/vulnerable-example`)

## Acknowledgements

Scout is an open source vulnerability analyzer developed by [CoinFabrik's](https://www.coinfabrik.com/) Research and Development team.

We received support through grants from both the [Web3 Foundation Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master) and the [Aleph Zero Ecosystem Funding Program](https://alephzero.org/ecosystem-funding-program).

| Grant Program | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| ![Web3 Foundation](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/main/assets/web3-foundation.png) | **Proof of Concept:** We collaborated with the [Laboratory on Foundations and Tools for Software Engineering (LaFHIS)](https://lafhis.dc.uba.ar/) at the [University of Buenos Aires](https://www.uba.ar/internacionales/index.php?lang=en) to establish analysis techniques and tools for our detectors, as well as to create an initial list of vulnerability classes and code examples. [View Grant](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/web3-grant) \| [Application Form](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/ScoutCoinFabrik.md).<br><br>**Prototype:** We built a functioning prototype using linting detectors built with [Dylint](https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint) and expanded the list of vulnerability classes, detectors, and test cases. [View Prototype](https://coinfabrik.github.io/scout/) \| [Application Form](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/ScoutCoinFabrik_2.md). |
| ![Aleph Zero](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/main/assets/aleph-zero.png) | We improved the precision and number of detectors for the tool with a multi-phase approach. This included a manual vulnerability analysis of projects within the Aleph Zero ecosystem, comprehensive testing of the tool on leading projects, and refining its detection accuracy. |
