Scout is an extensible open-source tool intended to assist ink! smart contract developers and auditors detect common security issues and deviations from best practices. 

This tool will help developers write secure and more robust smart contracts.

Our interest in this project comes from our experience in manual auditing and our usage of comparable tools in other blockchains.
To improve coverage and precision, weÂ´ll persist in research efforts on static and dynamic analysis techniques. Find more about our ongoing research at our associated repository.

## Quick Start

Scout is currently available only for Linux/Mac. For a quick start, install Scout by running the following commands:

```bash
cargo install cargo-scout
cargo-dylint dylint-link
```

To run Scout on your project, navigate to its root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cargo scout
```

If you're using Windows, you can still run Scout by installing the [Windows Subsistem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and using Bash.


For more information on installation and usage, please refer to the [Getting Started](http://localhost:3000/docs/intro) section in our documentation below.
