Scout is an extensible open-source tool intended to assist ink! smart contract developers and auditors detect common security issues and deviations from best practices. 

This tool will help developers write secure and more robust smart contracts.

Our interest in this project comes from our experience in manual auditing and our usage of comparable tools in other blockchains.
To improve coverage and precision, weÂ´ll persist in research efforts on static and dynamic analysis techniques. Find more about our ongoing research at our associated repository.

## Quick Start

For a quick start, make sure that [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) is installed on your computer. Then, install Scout dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link
```

Afterwards, install Scout with the following command:

```bash
cargo install --path <PATH_TO_CARGO_SCOUT_FOLDER>
```

To run Scout on your project, navigate to its root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cargo scout
```

For more information on installation and usage, please refer to the [Getting Started](https://coinfabrik.github.io/scout/docs/intro) section in our documentation below.

## Tests

To validate our tool, we provide a set of code examples located in the [test-cases](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout/tree/main/test-cases) folder.

In order to run the integration tests, navigate to `apps/cargo-scout` and run:

```console
cargo test --all --all-features
```

In order to run the tests for a particular test case, run the same command on that particular test-case folder (e.g: `test-cases/delegate-call/vulnerable-example`)
